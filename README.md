Face Mask Detection using Convolutional Neural Network model
Since the outbreak of covid-19, wearing a mask has been required by the government. Also, it is widely used by tech companies like Uber. In this project, machine learning techniques was used to identify if people wear masks or not. In this project, given a picture, the CNN model can detect if a face mask is worn or not.
Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/wobotintelligence/face-mask-detection-dataset
Data set contains 3GB images about people with/without masks. Images are labelled as face with mask, face with other covers and face with no mask. A total of 6024 images in the dataset.
