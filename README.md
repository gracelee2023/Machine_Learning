Face Mask Detection using Convolutional Neural Network model

Following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the government has mandated the wearing of masks. In this project, machine learning techniques, specifically a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, were utilized to discern whether individuals were wearing masks in given images.
